//  Description:
//  SearchView represents the search interface in the BackBlog app.
//  As of now, this view is a placeholder and will be further developed
//  to include functionalities such as searching for movies, users, or
//  playlists within the app.

import SwiftUI

// Defines the view for the search functionality within the app.
struct SearchView: View {
    // The body of the SearchView.
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Currently, the view contains only a placeholder text.
            // Future implementations will include a search bar, result listings,
            // and other relevant search-related UI components.
