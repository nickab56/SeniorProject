//  Description:
//  SocialView is intended to be the social interaction hub within the BackBlog app.
//  This view will potentially feature user interactions, social media integrations,
//  and community features related to movie playlists. Currently, it is a placeholder
//  and will be developed further to include these functionalities.

import SwiftUI

// Defines the view for social interactions within the app.
struct SocialView: View {
    // The body of the SocialView.
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Placeholder text indicating the current state of the view.
            // Future development plans include implementing features such as
            // user comments, sharing options, and social media feeds or integrations.
            Text("Social View")
        }
    }
}
